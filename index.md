## About Me
My name is Zaire Sims. I am 22 years old, I am a senior in college and will be graduating in the fall of 2021. I attend Rowan University. I have many hobbies that i like to do with friends and family. They include watching sports especially football. My favorite football team is the Los Angeles Chargers. I love to go fishing with friends as well but most importantly with my grandpa and grandma. We try to make countless memories because as we all know everything does not last forever. He taught me everything I know about fishing and will continue the legacy with my future kids and their kids. I am a very outgoing person, I can make friends and talk to people very easily that is one of my skill sets.
